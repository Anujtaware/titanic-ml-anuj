## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
- Training samples: 891
- Test samples: 418
- Target variable: `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Handling missing values (Age, Embarked)  
3. Feature encoding (Sex, Embarked)  
4. Feature selection  
5. Train–test split  
6. Model training  
7. Prediction and evaluation
